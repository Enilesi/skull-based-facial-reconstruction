    Look at where the face is widest at cheek level

    Click the outermost point, not the eye socket

Zygion Right (ZyR)

    Same as ZyL, but on the right side

    Distance ZyL–ZyR = ZYB

Euryon Left (EuL)

    The widest point of the skull on the left

    Higher than the cheekbones

    Usually near the parietal bone bulge

Euryon Right (EuR)

    Same as EuL, but on the right

Distance EuL–EuR = XCB

Using additional landmarks:
5. G – glabella (brow ridge midline)
6. N – nasion (nose root)
7. OrL – left orbitale (lowest orbital point)
8. OrR – right orbitale
